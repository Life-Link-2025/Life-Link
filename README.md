# What is Life Link?
Life Link is a mobile application designed to improve the 911 emergency response system. The app aims to address critical issues such as long wait times, inaccurate location tracking, language barriers, and accessibility challenges for marginalized groups, including individuals with disabilities and non-English speakers.

Life Link is built using the Dart programming language and the Flutter framework, ensuring a smooth and responsive user interface across both iOS and Android platforms. To streamline the development process, I utilized FlutterFlow, a low-code platform, which accelerated the app's creation.

For the backend, Life Link leverages Firebase, a secure and scalable cloud platform that handles data management, user authentication, and real-time updates. With Firebase, I can ensure that the app delivers a reliable experience to users, even in emergency situations.

Life Link is designed to provide a reliable and accessible solution for those in need of urgent help. It simplifies the process of contacting emergency services, improves location accuracy, and offers accessibility features for all users, regardless of their background or abilities.
